1: This paper presents descriptions, advantages, and disadvantages of 14 popular data
mining and knowledge discovery methodologies, showing each method’s evolution as
well as the history of these techniques and what is considered to be state of the art. It
begins with an introduction to what data mining and knowledge discovery (KDD) is as
well as a brief history of the KDD process and how it has progressed. After that they
define basic terms in regards to process models, paradigms, methodologies,
techniques, and tools; followed by a review of the models as well as a comparative
study between them. Finally, they conclude with their own newly proposed methodology
and conclusions about the specific steps conducted. The paper divides the 14 data
mining and knowledge discovery methods and approaches into three subsections: KDD
related approaches, CRISP-DM related approaches, and other approaches. Most of the
approaches described in this paper are based on the first two subsections; therefore,
those main approaches are described in more detail. The KDD approach involves 9
steps in regards to discovering useful knowledge from data, whereas the CRISP-DM
approach is more of a life cycle overview containing phases, tasks, and relationships
within those tasks that move back and forth between phases. Other approaches include
the automation of data mining processes, Six-Sigma, etc.. Based on a comparative
analysis of all the approaches, the authors create a newly refined data mining process
that includes more specific phases than other approaches to avoid overlap (17
subprocesses).
\n 2.1: Authors claim that CRISP-DM is not mature enough to deal with the complexity of
today's problems. They emphasize the need for it to address growing problems in
relation to project management, organization, and quality.
2.2: Authors claim that approaches involving automated data mining processes are,
although helpful for non-expert data mining users, excluding the data understanding
step. They say this step is considered to be essential if you want to assess potential
problems and test improvements.
2.3: Authors claim that their refined data mining process can be used for developing any
kind of data mining and knowledge discovery project.
3: In support of 2.1 there are other papers that also focus on the ease of data mining
processes for Big Data projects that are transferable to today’s complexities. Dutta, et
al. [1] explored a Big Data project at a manufacturing company, and in their
consideration of the CRISP-DM approach, they seemed weary of the fact that it is
unknown if the framework could even be applied to their complex project. In addition,
Plumed et al. [2] claim CRISP-DM is too restrictive and needs to include exploratory
activities such as goal exploration, data source exploration and data value exploration.
Both support the claim that CRISP-DM is not suitable for Big Data projects.
